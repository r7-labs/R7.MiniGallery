==  Some additional steps to do:

1) Update reference to DotNetNuke.dll which is located in "~\bin" folder (if needed).
   Template assumes that project is created in "~\DesktopModules" folder
   *without* parent solution folder, so "..\..\bin\DotNetNuke.dll" is used for reference.
  
2) Set project build output path to "~\bin" folder in project options.
   It can be "..\..\bin" for the case, described above.
   
3) Disable automatic designer updates in project options. 

4) Run 01.00.00.SqlDataProvider as script under Host -> SQL on DNN site.

5) Create new module under Host -> Extensions from Manifest (.dnn) file.
